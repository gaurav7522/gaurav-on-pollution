    <h1>Air pollution in New Delhi</h1>
    
    <p>Air pollution occurs when harmful substances including particulates and biological molecules are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. It may cause diseases, allergies or death of humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. Human activity and natural processes can both generate air pollution.</p>

<p>Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide</p>

    <ol>
      
      <h3><li>Burning of Fossil Fuels:</h3> 
      <p>Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and other factory combustibles is one the major cause of air pollution. Pollution emitting from vehicles including trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause immense amount of pollution. Carbon Monooxide caused by improper or incomplete combustion and generally emitted from vehicles is a major pollutant along with Nitrogen Oxides, that is produced from both natural and man made processes.</p></li>
    
      <h3><li>Agricultural activities:</h3> 
      <p>Ammonia is a very common by product from agriculture related activities and is one of the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere. Use of insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities has grown quite a lot. They emit harmful chemicals into the air and can also cause water pollution.</p></li>
  
      <h3><li>Exhaust from factories and industries:</h3> 
      <p>Manufacturing industries release large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air thereby depleting the quality of air. Manufacturing industries can be found at every corner of the earth and there is no area that has not been affected by it. Petroleum refineries also release hydrocarbons and various other chemicals that pollute the air and also cause land pollution.</p></li>

      <h3><li>Mining Operations:</h3> 
      <p>Mining is a process wherein minerals below the earth are extracted using large equipments. During the process dust and chemicals are released in the air causing massive air pollution. This is one of the reason which is responsible for the deteriorating health conditions of workers and nearby residents.</p></li>

      <h3><li>Indoor air pollution:</h3> 
      <p>Household cleaning products, painting supplies emit toxic chemicals in the air and cause air pollution. Have you ever noticed that once you paint walls of your house, it creates some sort of smell which makes it literally impossible for you to breathe.</p></li>

    <a name="eoap"><h2>Effects of air pollution</h2></a>
    <ol>
      
      <h3><li>Respiratory and heart problems:</h3> 
      <p>The effects of Air pollution are alarming. They are known to create several respiratory and heart conditions along with Cancer, among other threats to the body. Several millions are known to have died due to direct or indirect effects of Air pollution. Children in areas exposed to air pollutants are said to commonly suffer from pneumonia and asthma.</p></li>

<h3><li> Global warming:</h3> 
      <p>Another direct effect is the immediate alterations that the world is witnessing due to Global warming. With increased temperatures world wide, increase in sea levels and melting of ice from colder regions and icebergs, displacement and loss of habitat have already signaled an impending disaster if actions for preservation and normalization aren’t undertaken soon.</p></li>

<h3><li>Acid Rain:</h3> 
      <p> Harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere during the burning of fossil fuels. When it rains, the water droplets combines with these air pollutants, becomes acidic and then falls on the ground in the form of acid rain. Acid rain can cause great damage to human, animals and crops.</p></li>

<h3><li>Eutrophication:</h3> 
      <p> Eutrophication is a condition where high amount of nitrogen present in some pollutants gets developed on sea’s surface and turns itself into algae and and adversely affect fish, plants and animal species. The green colored algae that is present on lakes and ponds is due to presence of this chemical only.This is also known as Algal Bloom</p></li>

<h3><li>Effect on Wildlife:</h3> 
      <p>Just like humans, animals also face some devastating affects of air pollution. Toxic chemicals present in the air can force wildlife species to move to new place and change their habitat. The toxic pollutants deposit over the surface of the water and can also affect sea animals.</p></li>

<h3><li>Depletion of Ozone Layer:</h3> 
      <p>Ozone exists in earth’s stratosphere and is responsible for protecting humans from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Earth’s ozone layer is depleting due to the presence of chlorofluorocarbons, hydro chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. As ozone layer will go thin, it will emit harmful rays back on earth and can cause skin and eye related problems. UV rays also have the capability to affect crops.</p></li>

<a name="sind"><h2>Smog in New Delhi</h2></a>

<h3>What is Smog?</h3>
<p>Smog is fog or haze intensified by smoke or other atmospheric pollutants. Smog in Delhi is an ongoing severe air-pollution event in New Delhi and adjoining areas in the National Capital Territory of India. Air pollution at this time peaked on both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels. It has been reported as one of the worst levels of air quality in Delhi since 1999.</p>

<h3>Incidents:</h3>
<ul>
<li>On 8 Nov 2017 low visibility has resulted in accidents across the city, notably a 24 vehicle pile-up on the Yamuna Expressway.</li>
<li>During the second day of third test of Sri Lankan cricket team in India in 2017-18 at Delhi, smog forced Sri Lanka cricketers to stop play and wear anti-pollution masks. Cricketer Lahiru Gamage reported to have shortness of breath. Nic Pothas, coach of Sri Lankan cricket team, reported that cricketer Suranga Lakmal had vomited regularly due to severe pollution effect on the Delhi ground. There was a haltage of play between 12:32 pm to 12:49 pm.</li>

    <a name="strap"><h2>Solutions to reduce air pollution</h2></a>
    <ol>
      <h3><li>Use public mode of transportation:</h3> 
      <p>Encourage people to use more and more public modes of transportation to reduce pollution. Also, try to make use of car pooling. If you and your colleagues come from the same locality and have same timings you can explore this option to save energy and money.</p></li>
      <h3><li>Conserve energy:</h3> 
      <p>Switch off fans and lights when you are going out. Large amount of fossil fuels are burnt to produce electricity. You can save the environment from degradation by reducing the amount of fossil fuels to be burned.</p></li>
      <h3><li>Understand the concept of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle:</h3> 
      <p>Do not throw away items that are of no use to you. In-fact reuse them for some other purpose. For e.g. you can use old jars to store cereals or pulses.</p></li>
      <h3><li>Emphasis on clean energy resources:</h3> 
      <p>Clean energy technologies like solar, wind and geothermal are on high these days. Governments of various countries have been providing grants to consumers who are interested in installing solar panels for their home. This will go a long way to curb air pollution.</p></li>
      <h3><li>Use energy efficient devices:</h3> 
      <p>CFL lights consume less electricity as against their counterparts. They live longer, consume less electricity, lower electricity bills and also help you to reduce pollution by consuming less energy.There is a rise in the series of innovations and experiments aimed at alternate and unconventional options to reduce pollutants.</p></li>
